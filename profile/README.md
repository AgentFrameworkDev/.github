# Agent Framework Dev Project

The **Agent Framework Dev Project** is a community-run GitHub organization providing free materials for instructor-led, hands-on, developer-focused training for building AI agents using modern frameworks and tooling.

Our current work centers on:

* **Microsoft Agent Framework** (open source, released Oct 2025)
* **Microsoft Foundry**
* Practical agent architectures, tools, and workflows
* Real-world patterns for building, evaluating, and operating AI agents

This organization hosts **open-source workshop materials, labs, and demos** used for instructor-led, hands-on events for developers learning to build AI-powered applications.
